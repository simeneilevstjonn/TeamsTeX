# TeamsTeX
Rendering of LaTeX content in Microsoft Teams

An app for rendering LaTeX content in Teams messages. Allows you to create beautiful mathematical expressions. 

Simply input LaTeX code and have it rendered by the app. Standardised LaTeX simplifies learning and reuse of code compared to a WYSIWYG editor.

It also offers the ability to disable math mode, to write longer LaTeX blocks, where you combine plain text with mathematical equations.
